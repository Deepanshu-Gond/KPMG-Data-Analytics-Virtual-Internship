# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
In this online program, I got to complete similar work that Graduates do at KPMG. I learned what it is like working at one of the world’s best data analytics teams and built the skills required to excel as an analytics consultant.

## Background

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached KPMG. Primarily, they need help with its customer and transactions data. 

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
The organisation has provided 3 data sets
- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

I reviewed the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two and emailed issues and some suggestions to mitigate them.
I used data quality framework table for this.

## Task 2: Data Insights
Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration;  Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. 

PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
Using visualisations to present insights
Developed a dashboard using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business context when presenting findings were:

- Demographic Analysis of sale among type of customer class
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value
- Which industry provides more profit
